The app on start renders 30 random images but on search renders the specific image.<br>
Just click(double click) on any image to set as wallpaper(sometimes double click because of function instance delay). SO better double click image to set it.

PhotoGrid uses [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/developers) to get images and doesn't hold any copywrite over images.<br>

## To Build 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on electron.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

This also runs the electron-builder to build windows setup.
 
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
